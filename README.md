# Test Whiteaway

- This is a simple html5 webapp. It does not load data from a remote web-service or any kind of API.

- The first solution uses bootstrap and vue js to handle events and routing.

- The second solution does not scale as well as the first one, uses Bootstrap and jQuery and relies on tabs for navigation between items of the site.

- Both use the same set of css style file compiled directly from the sass folder using compass. 

- In order to start editing and using compass you can navigate to the folder assets and write "compass watch" to start editing. Cache files were ignored using git.
